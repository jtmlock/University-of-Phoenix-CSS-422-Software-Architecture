Here is a summary of the group assignment activity. The purpose of the group activities is to provide a forum for discussing the CRM project. The team is adding mobile capabilities to a CRM system. There is one 10-point assignment which is done and submitted on a group basis. The others are individual papers. They are not group submissions. Ideally each team member will address a different facet of the project. However, no points will actually be deducted for an overlap.  

 

Wk 2 - Group: Collaborative Group Introductions [due Day 7] - This is the group assignment worth 10 points. Select one team member to submit the 10 point paper. Include as team members all who participated in in its construction. The grade is auto-replicated to each participating team member. Discussion may take place as the team desires (phone, video chat, etc.). Please summarize same to the discussion board for the small group. This discussion board is probably the easiest and simplest way to communicate with team members.
